## Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is a popular data mining approach that identifies associations between items frequently purchased together. It is extensively used in the retail industry for tasks such as cross-selling, up-selling, and customer segmentation.

This project demonstrates the use of the Apriori algorithm to extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules. By analyzing transactional data, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior and improve decision-making.

## Features

- **Frequent Itemset Mining**: Identifies groups of items frequently purchased together.
- **Association Rules Generation**: Discovers meaningful patterns based on support, confidence, and lift metrics.
- **Visualizations**: Includes graphical representations of discovered rules for better interpretability.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn
  - Mlxtend (for association rule mining)

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Market_Basket_Analysis.git
   cd Market_Basket_Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Market_basket.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Apply the Apriori algorithm to extract frequent itemsets.
   - Generate and analyze association rules.
   - Visualize the results.
